Directions
Season the chicken with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Whisk the garlic, ginger, chile pepper, paprika, coriander, tomatoes and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a 4-to-6-quart slow cooker. Add the chicken and stir to coat.
Cover and cook on high, 4 hours, adding the heavy cream and frozen peas during the last 15 minutes of cooking. Serve over rice; top with cilantro.
